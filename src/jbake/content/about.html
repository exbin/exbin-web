<p><strong>ExBin Project is non-commercial initiative to create binary data centered communication protocol and family of file formats.</strong></p>
<p>Main focus is given on abstraction, to specify meaning of data and to provide flexibility to combine various data types together and transform them when needed.</p>

<h2>Advantages</h2>
<ul><li><strong>Unified Data Structures</strong> - Unified tree structure should allow to combine any types of data</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility</strong> - Framework should provide data transformations/processing capability to solve compatibility issues</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensibility</strong> - Catalog of data types, metadata, relations and abstraction should allow better understanding of data</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency</strong> - Support for compression and encryption on sections or whole document should allow more secure and more effective representation of binary data</li></ul>

<h2>Project Scope</h2>
<p>Range of libraries, parsers, utilities and application based on XBUP protocol are part of the project.</p>
<ul><li>Protocol specification</li>
<li>Libraries for parsing and serialization to/from protocol</li>
<li>Editor for files encoded with protocol</li>
<li>Shared catalog of data types</li>
<li>Application service layer provider</li></ul>
